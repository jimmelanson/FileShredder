# FileShredder

Simple windows applications that turns your sensitive files into gibberish before deleting them. The program overwrites the file in 30 passes, each pass being a larger size than the pervious one. This makes your file about as irretrievable as it can get, unless the NSA is poking around your hard drive.

It's free.
